# JavaScript Quiz

This is a quiz app that uses Puppeteer to scrape every JavaScript question made by [Lydia Hallie](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions). It then packages these questions via a Netlify Function and generates 10 random questions for the user to answer.

Not a bad way to study some JavaScript!

## Setup

Clone this repo to your desktop and go to its root directory and run npm install to install its dependencies.

You will also need to install Netlify's CLI to run it locally.

- npm install netlify-cli -g

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run npm start to start the application. You will then be able to access it at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
